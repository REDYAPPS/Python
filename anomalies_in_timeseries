Introduction
This Notebook will help you to identify anomalies in your historical timeseries data (IoT data) in simple steps. 
Also, derive the threshold value for your historical data. This threshold value can be used to set rules in Watson IoT Platform, 
such that you get an alert when your IoT device reports an abnormal reading in the future.
